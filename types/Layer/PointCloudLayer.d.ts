export default PointCloudLayer;
/**
 * The basis for all point clouds related layers.
 *
 * @property {boolean} isPointCloudLayer - Used to checkout whether this layer
 * is a PointCloudLayer. Default is `true`. You should not change this, as it is
 * used internally for optimisation.
 * @property {THREE.Group|THREE.Object3D} group - Contains the created
 * `THREE.Points` meshes, usually with an instance of a `THREE.Points` per node.
 * @property {THREE.Group|THREE.Object3D} bboxes - Contains the bounding boxes
 * (`THREE.Box3`) of the tree, usually one per node.
 * @property {number} octreeDepthLimit - The depth limit at which to stop
 * browsing the octree. Can be used to limit the browsing, without having to
 * edit manually the source of the point cloud. No limit by default (`-1`).
 * @property {number} [pointBudget=2000000] - Maximum number of points to
 * display at the same time. This influences the performance of rendering.
 * Default to two millions points.
 * @property {number} [sseThreshold=2] - Threshold of the **S**creen **S**pace
 * **E**rror. Default to `2`.
 * @property {number} [pointSize=4] - The size (in pixels) of the points.
 * Default to `4`.
 * @property {THREE.Material|PointsMaterial} [material=new PointsMaterial] - The
 * material to use to display the points of the cloud. Be default it is a new
 * `PointsMaterial`.
 * @property {number} [mode=MODE.COLOR] - The displaying mode of the points.
 * Values are specified in `PointsMaterial`.
 * @property {number} [minIntensityRange=0] - The minimal intensity of the
 * layer. Changing this value will affect the material, if it has the
 * corresponding uniform. The value is normalized between 0 and 1.
 * @property {number} [maxIntensityRange=1] - The maximal intensity of the
 * layer. Changing this value will affect the material, if it has the
 * corresponding uniform. The value is normalized between 0 and 1.
